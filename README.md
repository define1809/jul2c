This is my simple translator from
[Julia++](https://github.com/yukatan1701/Julia-plus-plus) to C. 

In my opinion, translators are one of the most elegant types of programs that
directly illustrate the Church-Turing thesis: that the program is a Turing
machine that performs mapping over the alphabet.

## Current state:
Lexer done.
Parser in progress.

## Features:

## How to use it?

## How to learn it?
